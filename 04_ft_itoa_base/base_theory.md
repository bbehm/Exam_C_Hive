## Bases Explained

- The __Decimal__ number system we use every day has 10 digits {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and so it is __Base 10__. 
- A __Binary__ digit can only be 0 or 1, so is __Base 2__.
- __Base 4__ uses digits 0 to 3 to represent any real number, called __Quaternary__.
- __Base 8__ is __Octal__ and uses digits 0 to 7. 
- A __Hexadecimal__ digit can be {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F}, so is __Base 16__.

"The trick is to really think about how our base 10 
number system works--all the same ideas work in other bases, they
just have a different set of digits, which leads to different place
values in the numbers."
